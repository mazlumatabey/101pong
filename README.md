# 101pong

The goal of this project is to work on a 3D version of this game (or of theBreakoutgame by the way. . . ). Onlyone bat will be considered, moving only in the 0-altitude plan (which happens to be (Oxy)).

Your program must print:  
•The velocity vector of the ball  
•The coordinates of the ball after a given amount of time  
•The angle at which the ball will hit the bat (if it will indeed hit the bat, at anytime from t = 0)
